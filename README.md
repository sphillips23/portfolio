# Portfolio Project :smile:
This assignment tasked us with creating a personal portfolio. The portfolio consists of information about me, relevant projects, and links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Resume. 


# What Did I Learn?
Through this project I was able to further develop my HTML and CSS skills. I was also able to develop a greater understanding of all the necessary components that make up a web page. This includes a Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, and Cookies in addition to utilizing Google Analytics and Campaigns.
